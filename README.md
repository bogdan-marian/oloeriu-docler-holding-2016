## oloeriu interview project 

I'm not adding the exercice content
at this level and if requested I will olso delete the repository. For the moment
I consider that It is more eficient to share the work using github. 
 Simple instructions for testing the project. 
```
	git clone git@github.com:bogdan-marian/oloeriu-docler-holding-2016.git
	cd oloeriu-docler-holding-2016
	mvn package
```

cd target

you can copy the following files to any location you consider appropriate
- oloeriu-interview-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
- Settings.json
- log4j.properties

the jar file needs to be in the same folder with the settings file and the 
log configuration file
 
lunch the app using
java -jar oloeriu-interview-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

== 
Kind regards
bogdan marian oloeriu
